## Code to talk to the chatbot

###

You will think that the idea is a little difficult, but it is easy, especially since there are thousands of helpers on the Internet and they will explain to you how easy it is, as was explained to me.

Here I will put some of the codes that I used.

## Languages ​​used

- HTML language to create the structure.
- CSS language for organization and decoration.
- JavaScript language for writing commands.
## Some commands to make openai, whether Python or Node.js


These codes must be placed so that errors do not occur when executing the program and also to teach the codes correctly.

- For the Python language, you must start by installing openai, which is the following command.

The command: `pip install openai`

Then install the Python modules such as: "flask"

Then at the beginning of the code, you must put the following command.

The command: `import openai`, which is considered a library that must be added.

- For the Node.js language, you must start by installing openai, which is the following command.

Command: `npm install openai`

Then install the Node.js modules such as: "axios"

- In both languages, you must put the files in one file and add these codes to create the package files.

Command: `npm init -y`.

Command: `npm install express body-parser`.

- Put your own key that is on your page in [openai](https://openai.com/api/) and if you don't have it, you can add a new one.
